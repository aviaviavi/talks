    - Pulls by:
      - Host platform
      - Container runtime
      - Country
      - Arch
      - Companies
    - Invocations versus downloads of the container?

      - Every tuesday this year?
      - 2021?

+ A pull request is defined as up to two GET requests on registry manifest URLs (/v2/*/manifests/*).
+ A normal image pull makes a single manifest request.
+ A pull request for a multi-arch image makes two manifest requests.
+ HEAD requests are not counted.

** Challenges with measuring pulls
   :PROPERTIES:
   :END:
   - A "pull" spans multiple API calls
     - Event processors must be stateful, and must include a notion of identity at the request level.
   - A "normal" image pull vs "abnormal"
   - Manifests vs blobs
   - Different clients have different behavior
** Theory vs practice
*** In theory
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_COL: 0.4
    :BEAMER_ENV: block
    :END:
    Clients will call HEAD for the manifest and only call GET when updates are needed.
*** In practice
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_COL: 0.4
    :BEAMER_ENV: block
    :END:
    Many clients will just call GET every time.
    Examples:
      - GoHTTPClient
      - Older versions of Watchtower
      - Older versions of Diujn
      - Older versions of Docker for Mac
** It's actually even worse

** Headers are rich in information
*** A notion of uniqueness
    You may have had 1000 downloads today but from only 5 distinct sources
*** IP request metadata
    - Where are your users distributed geographically?
    - Are your downloads coming from companies or individuals? Which companies?
    - Laptops or CI?
    - Which clouds?
*** Container runtime
    - Docker, containerd, cri-o, Watchertower?
    - If lots old versions are involved, your pull counts are likely inflated!
*** Platform
    What is the breakdown of host OS? Arch?
** So what else can the registry see?

    Put a service in front of the registry that:

** How Scarf built its container registry gateway
   (to be open-sourced soon)
*** Phase 1
    /A general recommended approach to anyone wanting to get started building their own/
    :PROPERTIES:
    :END:
    - Nginx
      - Send access logs to storage (we were using AWS Cloudwatch)
      - Lua for any custom business logic you might want, eg reading configs from Redis
    - Process logs asyncronously to generate analytics & insights
*** Phase 2
    :PROPERTIES:
    :END:
    - Server as hand-written Haskell code
    - Configuration in-memory
    - Send access logs to time series storage, eg Kafka
    - ~distribution~ as a pull-through-cache when we are forced to proxy
** Data privacy
   
   /This can be done while still completely preserving end-user privacy./
   
   - Depending on how you store and process this data, you may or may not run into compliance considerations like GDPR
   - Recommendations:
     - Don't touch PII you don't need
     - Delete it once you are done processing it
     - Leverage 3rd parties to handle it on your behalf
     - Consult legal counsel
 
** Other benfenfits of the gateway approach
   
   - Distribute from your own domain, not someone else's
   - Ability to switch registries on-the-fly without breaking anything downstream.
     - Dual publishing can keep your containers online when primary registry goes down
     
** Notable challenges
   
   - Easy to build, harder to scale
     - Multi-region availability, redundancy, etc is where the real complexity lives
   - Proxying as little as possible
   - Many competing container runtimes / clients -> edge-case bugs

** Tying it together
   
   - Registry data can be useful!
   - Your current registry provider doesn't provide access to pull data, but there are still ways to get to it.
   - Registry gateways can be a reasonable option

** Thank you!
